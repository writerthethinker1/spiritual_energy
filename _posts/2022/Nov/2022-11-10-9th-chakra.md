So, it is time to reach the 9th chakra? Let’s try it!

What you’ll need:

1. shungite water: let shungite soak in water for at least 15 minutes. Drink some prior to meditation.

Now it is time to meditate! This meditation is for 15 minutes. You can have a helper stone like quartz or a moonstone. A cinntamani also wouldn’t be so bad either, too!

This one has the chakra association with the crown, don’t use third eye, it does n’t help you see yourself.

Start with 20 deep breaths, then do 10 shallow breaths right after the 20. Then hold for 30 seconds. From here, do 10 shallow breaths and then right after these 10 do 20 deep breaths again. Hold for 30 seconds. Now, this is the last part: do 20 deep breaths and 20 shallow breaths. Hold for 60 seconds. This should put you at the 9th.

To let this one grow, do the meditation 60 times! You’re gonna see some fun and not so fun stuff about yourself! Like seeing you from a different view.

> “Oh, I think I am like this, but I’m really like that.” Maybe you’ll think. Some stuff you won’t like about yourself and other stuff you’ll just love! You’ll see it all, your good, bad, pretty, ugly, dumb, cleaver, and so on....

How you think you are isn’t how you really are. Same with others, how they see you isn’t how you really are.
