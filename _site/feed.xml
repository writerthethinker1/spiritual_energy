        <title>Accessing 20+ Chakras</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Time: 20min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound: Lambda Waves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone: Shungite Philosopher Stone or Plain Shungite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink 4oz of quintessence before this meditation. Do 5 standing breaths before being seated! Now, while being seated, do 70 deep breaths! Hold for 50 seconds. Drink 4oz of quintessence and continue breathing deeply for 30 breaths and 30 shallow ones. End breathing with an 80 second hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes you from chakra 19 to 20, 21, 22, 23, …, to the last chakra! You’ve traveled them all! How’s it feel?! Power? Energy? Supra-divine? Going a notch past divine? The last chakra is a multiple of…8! So, it is for supra-divine beings!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessing 13-19 Chakras</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Time: 15min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound: Lambda Waves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone: Shungite Philosopher Stone or Plain Shungite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink 4oz of quintessence before meditation to charge the body. Start with 20 shallow breaths and then 40 deep breaths. Then, drink 4oz of quintessence again during the meditation. Now, hold the breath for 30sec. and continue with 30 deep breaths and 20 shallow ones! Hold the breath for 70 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have dipped from the 12th to the 13th and after this, you are traveling the rest until the 19th! Good work! This isn’t easy to do, not for most of us! How’s it feel? Chakra 19?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessing Buddhas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to be with the Buddhas? Okay, I’m about to tell you how to hang out with them and relax during meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink nothing but tap water. No ice! Chilled is better. You can sweeten it with brown sugar if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you come back, drink some matcha, brown sugar if fine. Cold brew! No milk in matcha too. No ginger as well nor mint. Plain matcha optionally sweetened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold on to the Buddha stone with your left hand; don’t let it see sunlight during this process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do this after having the first meal or at 04:00-05:00. It works best during this time! Let the food digest for maybe 60-90min. before trying. You need to not be full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by being standing. Stand for 10 breaths. Breath in and out as you wish. But, keep count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, sit down on the ground (straw optional, and a pillow is nice if you have one for a cushion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take 5 deep breaths. In and out. Pause and focus your mind on your surroundings, eyes closed. What do you hear? Bird chirping? People talking? Just take mental note and be mindful about it. Now, another 5 breaths. Same way. Notice again. One more time, 5 breaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third try don’t try to notice anything and recite ‘om mani peme hum (hri)’ 108 times! Use the mala to count. And don’t verbalise the ‘hri’ part. Say it “inside your head” like you are reading it. Try to block out outside distractions while you do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, use the Buddha stone and touch it to your mala. Eyes can be open. You’re done. Relax and recline for the rest of the time. Take in the sunshine! Breathe fresh air! Have some water!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the timer is done, have some fresh matcha. Or drink when stone touches mala for 1min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time: 15-60min. with stone, 45-180min. without stone, 90-360min. without mala and stone, 60sec. if you wear a special watch (quartz), special instructions (where it for the whole day, it releases energy like Buddha for the whole day, solar powered too, don’t eat anything while wearing it, drinks only. Water is good. Chocolate is good. Just these two for rest of day. Water and chocolate if you are hungry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can meditate for more than 15min, but the minimum is 15min. The more time you put in, the stronger the charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Birthday Meditation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Try it out on your birthday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound: Lambda Waves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with 10 deep breaths. Then 10 shallow ones. Then 6 deep breaths, conclude with 6 shallow ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End by holding for 3 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes the philosopher stone frequency higher! You’ll heal the brain faster.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessing the 9th Chakra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, it is time to reach the 9th chakra? Let’s try it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shungite water: let shungite soak in water for at least 15 minutes. Drink some prior to meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to meditate! This meditation is for 15 minutes. You can have a helper stone like quartz or a moonstone. A cinntamani also wouldn’t be so bad either, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has the chakra association with the crown, don’t use third eye, it does n’t help you see yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with 20 deep breaths, then do 10 shallow breaths right after the 20. Then hold for 30 seconds. From here, do 10 shallow breaths and then right after these 10 do 20 deep breaths again. Hold for 30 seconds. Now, this is the last part: do 20 deep breaths and 20 shallow breaths. Hold for 60 seconds. This should put you at the 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To let this one grow, do the meditation 60 times! You’re gonna see some fun and not so fun stuff about yourself! Like seeing you from a different view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Oh, I think I am like this, but I’m really like that.” Maybe you’ll think. Some stuff you won’t like about yourself and other stuff you’ll just love! You’ll see it all, your good, bad, pretty, ugly, dumb, cleaver, and so on….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you think you are isn’t how you really are. Same with others, how they see you isn’t how you really are.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessing the 12th Chakra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a helper stone to do this, choose from red carnelian, amethyst, or lemon quartz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wear something magnetic before meditation. Iron or neodymium is okay. This is for the brain and nerves! Make sure to follow up with philosopher stone water!!! Do this one alone. No one around. The 11-12 chakras are meant to be done alone, by yourself. No one can really be there to help you, but others can give you guidance. Chakras 1-10 you can be around people or have them in mind. The last 2 must be alone. Animals around you is fine for 1-12.  Be distant from others for the last 2, by a tree stump alone. Maybe 6 feet distance or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is tricky, it’s the highest one for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by taking in 50 deep breaths! Then, hold the breath for 30 seconds, exhale, and do 40 deep breaths. Hold for 10 seconds and do another set of 10 breaths. Then, hold the breath for 30 seconds. Conclude with 12 shallow breaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To let this chakra manifest, do 30/30 meditations with 2 extra!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessing the 11th Chakra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To reach the 11th chakra, follow these steps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a higher chakra outside of the main 7, you’ll need a helper stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a stone to assist you, use black obsidian and hold on to it during the meditation. Keep the meditation for 10min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by taking in deep breaths, 20 inside and out. Each inhale and exhale is 1 count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, hold the breath for 1 minute or 60 seconds. You’ll feel lightheaded and this is okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhale, and start again. Do this process a total of 3 times, 60 breaths total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meditation is done! End with one inhale and exhale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This meditation is best done at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
