You’ll need a helper stone to do this, choose from red carnelian, amethyst, or lemon quartz.

> Wear something magnetic before meditation. Iron or neodymium is okay. This is for the brain and nerves! Make sure to follow up with philosopher stone water!!! Do this one alone. No one around. The 11-12 chakras are meant to be done alone, by yourself. No one can really be there to help you, but others can give you guidance. Chakras 1-10 you can be around people or have them in mind. The last 2 must be alone. Animals around you is fine for 1-12.  Be distant from others for the last 2, by a tree stump alone. Maybe 6 feet distance or something.

This one is tricky, it’s the highest one for now.

Start by taking in 50 deep breaths! Then, hold the breath for 30 seconds, exhale, and do 40 deep breaths. Hold for 10 seconds and do another set of 10 breaths. Then, hold the breath for 30 seconds. Conclude with 12 shallow breaths.

Done!

To let this chakra manifest, do 30/30 meditations with 2 extra!
