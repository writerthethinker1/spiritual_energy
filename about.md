# About this Blog

Hello and welcome to *spiritual energy*, my blog all about spirituality. I am Ramneek Narayan, *Buddha of Truth*, I have attained Nirvana using Truth meditation. After I became a Buddha, I noticed how my thoughts and actions connected and saw higher states of being. I started making my own meditations to heal mentally and physically alongside the Wim Hof method and found these special mantras to better use divine items. I learned about rituals and rites and how karma shapes our mind and reality today. This blog started as a grassroots effort to preserve spirituality and enlightenment in the modern age. As a scientist, I know that mostly we use the concepts from spirituality to help with the main stuff, but really spirituality can be its own thing and just as strong as science. Ideally, we fuse spirituality and science into one for best results. When I became Buddha, I knew how to do this well and to this day, I can use both spirituality and science together in unison. They both are just *different sides of the same coin.* This blog gives any updates and new information I have regarding the chakras, planets, philosopher stones, and other stuff for healing within. It is dedicated to spiritual matters only and hopefully the reader can grow their spirit as well as their intellect. As above, so below! Good wishes!
