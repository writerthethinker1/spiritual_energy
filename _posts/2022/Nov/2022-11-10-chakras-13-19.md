Time: 15min.

Sound: Lambda Waves

Stone: Shungite Philosopher Stone or Plain Shungite

Drink 4oz of quintessence before meditation to charge the body. Start with 20 shallow breaths and then 40 deep breaths. Then, drink 4oz of quintessence again during the meditation. Now, hold the breath for 30sec. and continue with 30 deep breaths and 20 shallow ones! Hold the breath for 70 seconds!

You should have dipped from the 12th to the 13th and after this, you are traveling the rest until the 19th! Good work! This isn't easy to do, not for most of us! How's it feel? Chakra 19?
