To reach the 11th chakra, follow these steps!

Since this is a higher chakra outside of the main 7, you’ll need a helper stone.

You’ll need a stone to assist you, use black obsidian and hold on to it during the meditation. Keep the meditation for 10min.

Start by taking in deep breaths, 20 inside and out. Each inhale and exhale is 1 count.

Then, hold the breath for 1 minute or 60 seconds. You’ll feel lightheaded and this is okay.

Exhale, and start again. Do this process a total of 3 times, 60 breaths total.

The meditation is done! End with one inhale and exhale.

> This meditation is best done at night.
