Time: 20min.

Sound: Lambda Waves

Stone: Shungite Philosopher Stone or Plain Shungite

Drink 4oz of quintessence before this meditation. Do 5 standing breaths before being seated! Now, while being seated, do 70 deep breaths! Hold for 50 seconds. Drink 4oz of quintessence and continue breathing deeply for 30 breaths and 30 shallow ones. End breathing with an 80 second hold.

This takes you from chakra 19 to 20, 21, 22, 23, ..., to the last chakra! You've traveled them all! How's it feel?! Power? Energy? Supra-divine? Going a notch past divine? The last chakra is a multiple of...8! So, it is for supra-divine beings!
